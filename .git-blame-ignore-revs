# This file lists all the commits that should be ignored by git-blame, like e.g.:
# - namespace changes,
# - formatting updates,
# - copyright updates,
# as those changes are not meaningful from application logic and git-blame user perspective.
#
# Please don't use it for other changes - it should only list commits that were (automated) bulk edits which are "guaranteed to work".
#
# You can use it on demand by supplying it to your git-blame call:
#
#    git blame --ignore-revs-file .git-blame-ignore-revs <file>
#
# or you can add a permanent setting in your git config:
#
#    git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs
#
# If you introduce a change that should be ignored – please amend this list with:
# - comment that contains the commit name and the reason for ignoring this change,
# - full commit hash.
#
# If you are adding something to the list with a delay – please keep chronological order.
#
# Ignored commits:

# all: switch namespace, apply format 
# reason: srsran:: to ocudu:: namespace change

# ocudu: rename ntn namespace
# reason: srs_ntn:: to ocudu_ntn namespace change
