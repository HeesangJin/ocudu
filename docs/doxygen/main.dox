OCUDU is a complete 5G RAN solution, featuring an ORAN-native
CU/DU developed by [SRS](https://www.srs.io/).

The solution includes a complete L1/2/3 implementation with minimal external
dependencies. Portable across processor architectures, the software has been
optimized for x86 and ARM. OCUDU follows the 3GPP 5G system architecture
implementing the functional splits between distributed unit (DU) and
centralized unit (CU). The CU is further disaggregated into control plane
(CU-CP) and user-plane (CU-UP).

See the [OCUDU](https://www.ocudu.org/) for information, guides and
project news.

This is the API documentation for OCUDU, generated from the source
code by [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/). For application features, build
instructions and user guides see the [OCUDU
documentation](https://docs.srsran.com/projects/project).
