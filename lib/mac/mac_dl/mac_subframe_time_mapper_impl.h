/// timestamp using a single 64-bit atomic variable, enabling efficient lock-free concurrent access.
///
/// The 64-bit value packs:
/// - Upper 14 bits: SFN (10 bits) + subframe index (4 bits)
/// - Lower 50 bits: Truncated timestamp (nanoseconds since epoch)
///
/// Updates occur only at subframe boundaries (subframe_slot_index == 0), providing a reference mapping every 1ms.
/// The full timestamp is recovered from the 50-bit truncated value using the current system time. Since the
/// truncated timestamp wraps every ~13 days and typical query latency is <1ms, reconstruction is always accurate.
